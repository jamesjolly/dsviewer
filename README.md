dsviewer
========

An example PCL-based cloud viewer for the DS325. Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

To get started, add the appropriate DepthSenseSDK include and lib dirs to
the include_directories and link_directories lists in CMakeLists.txt. Then
build as you would any PCL project:

cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
